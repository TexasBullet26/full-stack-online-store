# Full-Stack Online Store

Full-stack online clothing store using React, GraphQL, Apollo Client, GraphQL Yoga, and Prisma.

## Technology Stack

  - `Next.js` for server-side rendering, routing, and tooling
  - `Styled Components` for styling
  - `React-Apollo` for interfacing with Apollo Client
  - `Jest` and `Enzyme` for testing
- `Apollo Client` for data management and:
  - Performing GraphQL _Mutations_
  - Fetching GraphQL _Queries_
  - _Caching_ GraphQL data
  - Managing _Local State_
  - _Error_ and _Loading_ User-Interface states
  - _Apollo Client replaces the need for redux + data fetching/caching libraries_

**Backend**:
